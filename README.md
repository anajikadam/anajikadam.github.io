## **Work Experience**
[**Culinda Inc.,**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/culinda/) | Data Science Intern [*Certificate*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lkHbWUoBcfODLShqTDxYzkQvCsg_myfo/view) | (Aug 2022 – Jan 2023)

**Skills: Python, CyberSecurity, Statistics, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, IoT/IoMT**
- Created a POC using Python on Cyber risk quantification using FAIR, STRIDE Model for quantifying
cyber risk to IoMT/IoT devices.
- Wrote Python scripts that analyzed Terabytes of data to generate (text & excel) reports that checked if the data flow in
the pipeline is happening as expected. (Data Validator Tool)
- Worked in Baselining for hospitals' network data to identify any malicious behavior.

## **Projects**

### **NLP Projects**
- **Topic Modeling Using RACE Dataset** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Topic-Modelling-Using-RACE-Dataset)
  - **Technologies Used:**  Python, Regex, NLTK, Gensim, ScikitLearn, tSNE, pyLDAvis, bokeh, Git
  - This **NLP Project** aims to use statistical models to reveal the abstract “topics” present in a large set of text documents, thus trying to classify documents based on different themes they convey.
  - Three **Topic Modeling algorithms** were used namely, **Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF)**.
  - **BERTopic** & **Top2Vec** were also explored which gave quite good results.


- **Medical Embeddings and Clinical Trial Search Engine** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Medical-Embeddings-and-Clinical-Trial-Search-Engine)
  - **Technologies Used: Python, Gensim, Word2Vec, FastText, Streamlit, Git**
  - The Project aims to train SkipGram and FastText Models on COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dataset and builds a Search Engine where user can type any COVID-19 related keyword and it presents all the top n similar results from the dataset

### **Computer Vision Projects**
- **Image Coloring using Autoencoders** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Image-Coloring-using-Autoencoders)
    - **Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-image, matplotlib, numpy**
    -  I tried using Autoencoders and Transfer Learning for this one. I tried VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2 as an encoder/feature extractor layer and a custom decoder layer.


- **Muti-class Image Classification Model** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Image-Classification-CNN-Model-for-Real-Time-Prediction)
    - **Technologies Used: Python, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, flask, gunicorn, pathlib, numpy**
    - The project aims to classify images into driving license, social security, and others category by using a CNN model architecture.
    - An accuracy of 96% was achieved on test data of 150 images. Deployment was done using gunicorn and flask API.

### **Machine Learning & Python Projects** 

- **Business License Status Prediction** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Business-License-Status-Prediction)
  - **Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, h2o, tensorflow, flask, gunicorn**
  - The project aims to predict if a customer's license should be issued, renewed, or cancelled depending on features in the dataset. The problem statement was presented at [ZS Data Science Challenge - 2019](https://www.interviewbit.com/contest/zs-yds-2019/).


- **Medical Data Extraction Project** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/medical-data-extraction-project)
  - **Technologies Used: Python, Regex, OpenCV, Pytesseract, FastAPI**
  - Python backend was built using pytesseract, OpenCV, Regular expressions and FastAPI as a web serving framework
  - Auto extracted important fields from patient details and medical prescriptions. Image processing was performed in OpenCV and then pytesseract was used for image to text conversion. The last step was to use Regular Expression (Regex) for extracting important fields from the text


- **SQL Project: Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain**
    - [Project Github Link](https://github.com/avr2002/sql-project-consumer-goods-domain) & [Certificate of Participation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QdbMXJoyvD8SASKbZYQelT-uQamhiEQ4/view?usp=share_link)
